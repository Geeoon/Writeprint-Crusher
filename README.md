# Writeprint Crusher
Prevents forensic linguistics.  Allows you to convert between identities (idiolects)

## Supports Switching Between:
* American-English and British-English
* Hyphenated and non-hyphenated compound words
* Single spaces and double spaces after a period
* Capitalized and non-capitalized beginning of sentences
* Oxford and no Oxford comma
* Apostrophe or no apostrophe on words like won't and can't
* Commas before prepositions (FANBOYS)
* Periods between acronyms

## Analyzes Text:
* Warns of uncommon words or phrases

## What's This Used For?
Can be used for maintaining anonynimity when changing identities.

For example, if a user had multiple blogs, but didn't want their typing patterns link them together or to themselves, they could use Writeprint Crusher to convert their normal typing patterns into a different identity.  This makes it much harder to perform forensic linguistics to determine authorship.
